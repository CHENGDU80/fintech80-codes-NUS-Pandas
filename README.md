## Project Overview

We are **NUSPandas**, representing the National University of Singapore in the **Chengdu80 Competition**. Our project aims to address a key challenge in the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry: providing reliable and responsive insurance solutions for AV owners, AV manufacturers, and insurance companies. We have developed a **blockchain-based, AI-driven insurance platform** designed to simplify and enhance the insurance experience for autonomous vehicle stakeholders.

### Problem Statement

As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, the need for specialized insurance policies that address the unique aspects of AV operations is crucial. Traditional insurance policies fall short in meeting the dynamic and data-driven requirements for AVs, which operate with real-time data from various IoT sensors. Our platform offers a modern approach by leveraging **blockchain technology and AI** to address these unique needs, including streamlined data processing, quick and transparent claim handling, and enhanced user experience.

## Project Features

### 1. Blockchain-Based IoT Data Streaming
- Our platform streams **IoT data** collected from autonomous vehicles to a **blockchain** system, ensuring data immutability, transparency, and security. The data includes critical information from the vehicleâ€™s sensors, such as accident details, timestamps, locations, and impact specifics. 
- This blockchain integration enables insurers and AV owners to trust the data, facilitating quicker claim resolutions and improving overall platform reliability.

### 2. AI-Powered Smart Assistant
- We integrated a **smart assistant** to support users in reporting and processing claims, gathering accident information, and estimating repair costs.
- The assistant uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze data, including accident severity and location, and to calculate liability and potential payouts based on predefined rules and AV insurance policies.
- The assistant also provides **real-time feedback** to users, helping them understand eligibility and claim outcomes with detailed justifications.

### 3. Targeted Solutions for AV Stakeholders
Our platform is tailored to serve three primary stakeholders:
   - **AV Owners:** Users can conveniently report accidents, file claims, and receive immediate feedback on their policy status and potential claim outcomes.
   - **AV Insurance Companies:** Insurers benefit from a transparent, data-driven claims management system, with IoT data recorded immutably on the blockchain for easy validation.
   - **AV Manufacturers:** Manufacturers can access critical accident data insights, enabling them to improve vehicle safety and better understand accident trends.
